  <h3>About</h3>
  <p class="parahome">The Fare Friendly student pass organiser presents a solution to a common conundrum faced by students relying on train transportation. By simplifying the process of obtaining concessions, this system alleviates 
    the burden of purchasing tickets at regular fares, which can be prohibitively expensive for students already managing tight budgets. A key feature of this project is its focus on efficiency and convenience, offering students a user-friendly platform to interact with group data. </p>
 

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p class="parahome">Our platform offers a seamless experience for students to create, join, and view groups for train pass concessions. Students can easily form groups based on their location or class schedules, and submit them for admin approval. This streamlined process alleviates stress for both students and admins, ensuring that group formations are managed efficiently. Admins have the ability to oversee and approve group submissions, maintaining fairness and accessibility in group formations. This collaborative approach empowers students while providing admins with the necessary oversight to manage group memberships effectively.</p>
  
  <h3>Admin</h3>
  <p class="parahome">The admin dashboard for the Fare Friendly Student Pass Organiser empowers administrators with key responsibilities including approval, user management, group oversight, station management, and fare control. Administrators are tasked with approving user registrations, managing user accounts, overseeing group memberships, moderating group activities, maintaining station data, and adjusting fare pricing. This centralized hub ensures efficient management and upkeep of the student pass system, contributing to a smooth and seamless transportation experience for students.
